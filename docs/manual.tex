\section{Disclaimer}

The prototype that you are about to see is a laborious program written to
illustrate our basic ideas and concepts of what Food Busters is about.
This is prototype app that aims to focus on concept, interface \& UI,
and basic logic flow of the app. The goal of this prototype is to show the concept
and test that concept with real users for feedbacks. Some features are not properly implemented yet, thus this prototype is only capable of showing UIs with some logic flows.
We will go along each features in this manual.

This manual is for App Version 1.0.305. Just in case that newer version (bug fixes) may
have released, please check \href{https://github.com/Food-Busters/food_busters/releases}{HERE}

You can check the version of installed app by clicking \textit{info icon}

\section*{Sample Scan Result}

\figfour{scanafter_1}{scanafter_2}{scanafter_3}{recommend_food}{
    Points and Quotes}{Money Lost Data}{Meal and Menu Data}{Recommendation}

In the current version of the prototype, the quote you see is fetched from our website.
\href{https://food-waste-quotes.vercel.app}{https://food-waste-quotes.vercel.app}.
The quotes here are able to be updated dynamically by our team members,
meaning that you will need to connect to internet to see the results of
the \textbf{SMART Food Scanner}. Currently, the results in the other pages are mocked up,
however, the internet connection is still needed to gain access to this screen.

Once we have started the next stage of Food Busters, we will make sure to do
some researches to ensure the data here are correct.
