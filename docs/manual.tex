The prototype that you are about to see is a laborious program written to
illustrate our basic ideas and concepts of what Food Busters is about.
This is prototype app that aims to focus on concept, interface \& UI,
and basic logic flow of the app. The goal of this prototype is to show the concept
and test that concept with real users for feedbacks.

We will go along each features in this manual.
